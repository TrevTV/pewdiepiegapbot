# PewDiePie Gap Bot
A Discord bot that displays the gap between PewDiePie and T-Series but with terrible coding because I suck at Python.

# cool typy things
To display the gap type !gap.

Using the command !subcount {youtubername} and will display the number.

To get a random meme type !meme.

# programmy peeps

So yeah, coded by TrevTV (http://www.youtube.com/trevoraxe) and discord.py.
