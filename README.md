# PewDiePie Gap Bot
A Discord bot that displays the gap between PewDiePie and T-Series but with terrible coding because I suck at Python. To display the gap type !gap. The bot might take a few to read the data and do some math but then it will output the number. Using the command !subcount {youtubername} and will display the number. If you want to host your own version just download the master off Github. (plz give credit thx)
So yeah, coded by TrevTV (http://www.youtube.com/trevoraxe) and discord.py
