# PewDiePie Gap Bot
A Discord bot that displays the gap between PewDiePie and T-Series but with terrible coding because I suck at Python.

# cool typy things
To display the gap type !gap.

Using the command !subcount {youtubername} and will display the number.

To get a random meme type !meme.

Get dumb trump quotes by typing !trump.

Get sent a list of commands with !help.

Start a poll with !quickpoll {title} {option} {option} (you can have more than two options)

Tally votes for polls with !tally {pollid}

Find a Urban Dictionary definition of any word using !urban {word}.

Turn normal talk into owo using !owo {text}.
