# Attention!
I have decided to end the ThankYouPewDiePie bot. I had fun creating it but the war is over. I hope my bad, messy code may be able to help some beginners. If you want a bot like ThankYouPewDiePie check out my new bot "Vex"! [Click Here to invite it!](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=583089980134522941&permissions=8&scope=bot)

# PewDiePie Gap Bot
A Discord bot that displays the gap between PewDiePie and T-Series but with terrible coding because I suck at Python.

# cool typy things
To display the gap type !gap.

Using the command !subcount {youtubername} and will display the number.

To get a random meme type !meme.

Get dumb trump quotes by typing !trump.

Get sent a list of commands with !help.

Start a poll with !quickpoll {title} {option} {option} (you can have more than two options)

Tally votes for polls with !tally {pollid}

Find a Urban Dictionary definition of any word using !urban {word}.

Turn normal talk into owo using !owo {text}.

I am not updating this readme so for a full list of commands go [here](http://gaplk.gq/commands.html)
